S-Coda is a Python library for handling MIDI files.
S-Coda supports a plethora of different MIDI manipulation operations, such as:

- quantisation of notes
- quantisation of note lengths
- splitting sequences into bars
- transposing of sequences
- creating piano-roll visualisations of pieces
- judging the difficulty of pieces

S-Coda was used in our project [PAUL-2](https://github.com/FelixSchoen/PAUL-2) to process MIDI files.
For information about how to use S-Coda we refer to chapter 5 of the [thesis](https://doi.org/10.34726/hss.2023.103585) in which S-Coda was introduced.
